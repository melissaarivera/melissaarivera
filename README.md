# Programming Positions
**Astrophysics Research Assistant** | *Aramaki Lab* | Boston, MA |	September 2022 - Present
* Contribute to GRAMS (Gamma Ray and Anti-Matter Survey), a NASA Physics of the Cosmos mission, to contribute to the indirect dark matter search by analyzing and cross-matching large datasets for detection model optimization.
* Utilize Geant4, Python’s Astropy package, and statistical analysis techniques to construct all-sky maps and simulate high-volume particle interactions in the under-explored MeV gamma-ray energy range to gather missing pieces in our understanding of dark matter and the universe.
* Maintain detailed research documentation, track experimental results, and present data-driven findings and visualizations in regular status report meetings as an active member of GRAMS collaboration across institutions in U.S. and Japan.

**Astronomy Research Assistant** | *BU White Dwarf Group* |	Remote | June 2019 - January 2021
* Conducted research on White Dwarf (WD) stars observed by TESS, leveraging large datasets to analyze stellar variability and behavior.
* Optimized data accuracy and signal detection of 1,000+ WD’s using Microsoft Excel and Python packages (Lightkurve, Eleanor).
* Enhanced filtering techniques of transit data to enhance signal detection and identify two potential eclipsing binary stars.
